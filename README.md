> Best used with the [Linux EQ Launch Manager](https://gist.github.com/mgeitz/aa295061c51b26d53dd818d0ebb3e37a) to maintain reasonable log file size


## Install

Install from pypi
```sh
$ # Install Stable
$ pip3 install eqalert==2.2.0
$
$ # Install whatever I just pushed to pypi
$ pip3 install eqalert
```

_or_ install manually from github
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:mgeitz/eqalert.git
$ cd eqalert
$ pip3 setup.py install
```


## Getting Started

Start things up
```sh
$ eqalert
```

You should now see `~/.eqa/` with the following structure
```
$HOME/.eqa
        ⎿ config.json
        ⎿ log/
        ⎿ sound/
```

Spot check these default paths generated in `config.json`
```
    "settings": {
        "paths": {
            "alert_log": "[$HOME/.eqa/]log/",
            "char_log": "[$HOME]/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Sony/EverQuest/Logs/",
            "sound": "[$HOME/.eqa/]sound/"
        },
```

### Reaction Types

- `false`: Disable alerting for this line type
- `true`: Alert for matching strings under `alert` for the line type, using the set sound
- `speak`: Full text-to-speech for the entire line (probably don't enable this for `combat_other_melee`
- `all`: Alert for all lines of a given line type, using the set sound

- `true`: Alert for the given string of a line type
- `raid`: Alert for the given string of a line type when raid mode is enabled
