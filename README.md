> Best used with a [launch script](https://gist.github.com/mgeitz/aa295061c51b26d53dd818d0ebb3e37a) which maintains reasonable log file size



## Install

#### PyPI
```sh
$ pip3 install eqalert
$ # or if your distribution is using externally managed environemnts
$ pipx install eqalert
```

#### Locally
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mgeitz/eqalert.git
$ cd eqalert
$ python3 -m pip install -e .
$ # or if your distribution is using externally managed environments
$ # (remember the venv must be sourced to run eqalert when installed this way)
$ python3 -m venv .venv; source .venv/bin/activate; python3 -m pip install -e .
```

#### Docker
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mgeitz/eqalert.git
$ cd eqalert
$ docker compose build
$ docker compose run eqalert
```

> Note: If running through docker after installing and running on your host, update or regenerate `~/.eqa/config/settings.json` to reflect local container paths in `/home/eqalert`



## Getting Started

Start things up
```sh
$ eqalert
```

You should now see `~/.eqa/` with the following structure
```
$HOME/.eqa
        ⎿ config/
          ⎿ line-alerts/
        ⎿ data/
          ⎿ timers/
        ⎿ encounters/
        ⎿ log/
          ⎿ debug/
        ⎿ sound/
```

Spot check these default paths generated in `config/settings.json`
```
  "settings": {
    "paths": {
      "eqalert_log": "[$HOME/.eqa/]log/",
      "data": "[$HOME/.eqa/]data/",
      "encounter": "[$HOME/.eqa/]encounters/",
      "everquest_logs": "[$HOME]/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Sony/EverQuest/Logs/",
      "everquest_files": "[$HOME]/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Sony/EverQuest/",
      "sound": "[$HOME/.eqa/]sound/",
      "tmp_sound": "/tmp/eqa/sound/"
    },
  }
```

## Data

#### Spell Timers

EQ Alert will generate a file for spell timers in `data/spell-timers.json` by default by parsing `spells_us.txt` in your EverQuest directory.

This file will only regenerate if it is missing, malformed, or a newer `spells_us.txt` file is present.


#### Spell Casters

EQ Alert will generate/overwrite `data/spell-casters.json` each version.  This file contains which classes can cast a given buff which timers should be made for.


#### Spell Lines

Many spells cast in EverQuest share the same log output lines.  EQ Alert will generate/overwrite `data/spell-lines.json` each version as a mapping of which possible spells a given output line could be associated to.


#### Spell Items

EQ Alert will generate/overwrite `data/spell-items.json` each version as a mapping of which items a given spell could be cast by.


#### Players

EQ Alert uses in-game `/who` output to keep an up-to-date list of each seen players class, level, and guild organized by server in `data/players.json` for alerting spell duration.


#### Saved Timers

If the active character is changed or EQ Alert is stopped, all active timers are saved to a file in `data/timers/` by the previously active character and server name.  This file is consumed when the parser sets that character as active again, adding all non-expired timers back to the timer list.


## Encounters

When encounter parse saving is enabled, complete encounter reports are saved under `encounters/[zone_name]/[date]/` as the time stamp of the encounter and the encounter target.

## Custom Alerting

Modify `~/.eqa/config/line-alerts/*.json` to customize alerts.

Due to how many line matches there are, the configuration for their reactions have been split into several json files under `[$HOME/.eqa]/config/line-alerts/*.json`

Anything matched by the parser not found in configuration is automatically added to `[$HOME/.eqa]/config/line-alerts/other.json`

Modify `line_type` values to customize alerts accordingly.

### Line Types

Example configuration for a line type:
```
    "line_type_name": {
      "alert": {},
      "reaction": false,
      "sound": false
    },
```

#### Reaction Values

##### General
- `"alert"`: Alert for matching strings in `alert` for the line type using the set sound
- `"all"`: Alert for all lines of a given line type using the set sound
- `false`: Disable alerting for this line type

##### Context Driven
- `"afk"`: Alert only when afk
- `"group"`: Alert when in a group and raiding
- `"group_only"`: Alert only when grouped
- `"raid"`: Alert when in a raid
- `"solo"`: Alert when solo, grouped, and raiding
- `"solo_group_only"`: Alert only when not raiding
- `"solo_only"`: Alert only when solo

#### Alert Keys

`"alert"` can be populated with key value pairs.  The key here is any string you would like an alert for within that line type.

##### Examples

###### Example 1
Alert for the word `hey` when someone else `/says` it:

```
    "say": {
      "alert": {
        "hey": true
      },
      "reaction": "alert",
      "sound": "hey"
    },
```

###### Example 2
Alert for the word `run` when someone else `/says` it and you are grouped or in a raid:

```
    "say": {
      "alert": {
        "run": "group"
      },
      "reaction": "alert",
      "sound": "oh god run"
    },
```

###### Example 4
Alert for a spell not taking hold only when grouped:

```
    "spell_not_hold": {
      "alert": {},
      "reaction": "group_only",
      "sound": true
    },
```

###### Example 4
Alert for the item `Hand Made Backpack` when someone else `/auctions` it and is selling:

```
    "auction_wts": {
      "alert": {
        "Hand Made Backpack": true
      },
      "reaction": "alert",
      "sound": "wow buy that"
    },
```

> More examples can be referenced in the default config

#### Alert Values

##### General
- `false`: Disable alerting for the string (does not negate line type reactions)
- `true`: Alert for the string

##### Context Driven
- `"afk"`: Alert only when afk
- `"group"`: Alert when in a group and raiding
- `"group_only"`: Alert only when grouped
- `"raid"`: Alert when in a raid
- `"solo"`: Alert when solo, grouped, and raiding
- `"solo_group_only"`: Alert only when not raiding
- `"solo_only"`: Alert only when solo

#### Sound Values
- `false`: Play no sound when an alert is raised
- `true`: When an alert is raised speak the entire line

> Any other sound value (as a string) will be spoken as the audio trigger for that line type

#### The all Line Type

This line type behaves the same as any specific line type configuration, but configuration here will be used against all log lines.

For example, the below configuration will alert if the word `help` is found in any line while in a raid context, even if that line isn't matched to a type by the parser.

```
    "all": {
      "alert": {
        "help": raid
      },
      "reaction": "alert",
      "sound": "help is needed"
    },
```

This can be helpful if you would like to alert for something not yet matched by the parser, though your [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) to a new line type match in the parser would also be welcome!



## Zones
Zone data is stored in `config/zones.json`

#### indoors
Whether or not this zone is considered indoors.  Currently does nothing.

#### raid_mode
- `false`: If enabled, auto-disable raid mode in this zone
- `true`: If enabled, auto-enable raid mode in this zone

#### timer
- `#`: The value in seconds to associate to a default timer in a given zone

> Note: No support for zones with multiple default timers, stick with the manual timer command for those for now.  For zones with tiered default timers, the shortest timer was set as the default.  You can change this value to be any number in seconds you prefer.
